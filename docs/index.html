      <h2>Welcome to My Website (WIP, Last Updated 7/27)</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. It’s used to host every single thing about me—yes, even my personal passwords can be found in this domain. I’ve taken heavy precautions to track the clicks to my every subpart. Please excuse this uncreative homepage, I want my website to be as minimalist as possible because I am not. 

I’m a Taiwanese-American Senior at The Lovett School in Atlanta, Georgia, who is interested in three things: Philosophy, Statistics, and Anti-Corruption Efforts. I aspire to one day lead a successful VC firm. I am fluent in English and Mandarin, conversational in Spanish and Taiwanese  Hokkien, and currently learning Korean and French. I’m working to have this website translated into many languages.

If you’re looking to contact me, please email me at evanyclee1 [at] gmail [dot] com. I appreciate everyone who is 1. Able to find my website and 2. Visits (and reads) this page. So please feel free to ask me for anything!

I treat the parts (you can easily find) as my substack, and there are fun messages encrypted across the website. I’ll acknowledge your intellectual wit, donate $2 USD, or offer free startup advice to anyone who can tell me my favorite philosopher (HINT: you can find the answer on this website!). Just email me the answer :) 

//my response will be automated, and embedded within the lexical and rhetorical structure of the automated response is a hint towards my very secret, and personal folder.
