      <h2>Welcome to My Website!</h2>
      <p>
              My name is Evan Lee, and I’m a Taiwanese-American Senior at The Lovett School in Atlanta. 
              On this rather rudimentary website, I share some of my interests and independent/collaborative works. Whenever I find the time to
              actually learn CSS and HTML, beyond the elementary web-design elements of it, that is, I will for sure make this website prettier.
              But until then, the main updates you can expect to see here are textual translations of what I'm saying into multiple languages:
              Mandarin, Spanish, Korean (which I'm still learning), and German (which I just began learning).
      </p>
      <p> 
              Growing up, I was curious about the more technical and progressive aspects of the world and the subjects taught at school. Naturally, the core ideas of mathematics and technology appealed to me. But my interests in STEM have since shifted towards a broader curiosity toward learning about the world around us, and how we come to know what we know.
      </p>
      <p>
            That took me to ethics, and my interdisciplinary curiosity for the intersection between philosophy and math was explored through a semester-long independent study. Heavily influenced by Dr. Agustín Rayo’s “Paradox and Infinity” from MIT’s OpenCourseWare, I continue to interrogate the world around us and test understanding’s limits. But perhaps most importantly, I’ve come to realize the importance of placing unwavering faith in mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
            Anyways, the abovesaid is just some of the ways I perceive this world. If you’re critical of anything, let’s talk about it!
      </p>
      <p>
            The biggest project I am working on is editing an already-filmed documentary called 8 to 88: Formosan Fortune, 
            which emphasizes the Taiwanese identity and economy as an attempt to reframe geopolitical discussions surrounding the island. 
            It should be completed by 2026, and will likely be licensed through <a href="https://taiwanplus.com" target="_blank">TaiwanPlus</a>, a DPP-funded news outlet—but of course, nothing is final until it’s final.
      </p>
      <p>
            Research-wise, I am currently writing two papers: the first is an analysis of status quo applications of free speech in politics (for my History of Nonviolence Class), and the second is an accessibility critique of cancel culture in the debate space.
