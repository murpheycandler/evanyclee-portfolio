      <h2>Welcome to My Website (WIP, Last Updated 9/26)</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. It’s used to host every single thing about me. Please excuse this uncreative homepage, I am still learning html and css. I'm pushing to finish edits by November 1st. 

I’m a Taiwanese-American Senior at The Lovett School in Atlanta, Georgia. I am fluent in English and Mandarin, conversational in Spanish and Taiwanese  Hokkien, and currently learning Korean and French. I’m working to have this website translated into many languages.

If you’re looking to contact me, please email me at evanyclee1 [at] gmail [dot] com.
