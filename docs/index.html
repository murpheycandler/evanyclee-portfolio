      <h2>Welcome to My Website (WIP, Last Updated 10/25/25)</h2>
      <p>

Welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Evan Lee, and I’m a Taiwanese-American Senior at The Lovett School in Atlanta, Georgia. I’m interested in so many things about how our world works, but I’ve spent the most time learning about philosophy—primarily ethics. I’ve also dedicated a considerable amount of time to industrial engineering (stats/math-based) research and personally explored my own Taiwanese identity. 

I am currently editing a documentary called 8 to 88: Formosan Fortune, which discusses the Taiwanese identity and economy as an attempt to reframe geopolitical discussions surrounding the island. It should be completed by 2026! It will most likely be licensed through TaiwanPlus—but of course, nothing is final until it’s final.

I am currently writing two papers: the first is an analysis of status quo applications of free speech in politics, and the second is an accessibility critique of cancel culture in the debate space.  

My email is evanyclee1 [at] gmail [dot] com. Here is my CV
